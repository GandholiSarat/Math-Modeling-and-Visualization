# MLP from Scratch – PMAT 403 Project

This repository contains a NumPy-based implementation of a simple **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** as part of a project for my course on Pattern Recognition **PMAT 403**. It includes code for generating synthetic 2D datasets, training the MLP using different backpropagation strategies, and visualizing decision boundaries.

## 🧠 Features

- Custom `MLP` class built using NumPy
- Supports:
  - Standard Backpropagation
  - Backpropagation with Momentum
  - Adaptive Learning Rate
- Synthetic dataset generation using multivariate normal distributions
- Visualization of decision boundaries
- Evaluation of model performance (accuracy)

## 📁 File

- `PMAT_403.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all code, results, and plots.

## 🧰 Dependencies

Make sure you have Python installed with the following packages:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

To install dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
